    <h1 id="keep-austin-weird">Keep Austin Weird</h1>
<p>Why is this the city slogan?  We think it’s because of the many festivals, places, artists, and musicians that are special to Austin.  Its community supports originality and local-born businesses, like no other. </p>
<p>Below we listed some Austin gems that we think you’ll enjoy, including a few tips for Cinco de Mayo (for those who’ll be around the Monday after the wedding).  The city has lots more to offer than what’s listed below; we focused on places that are special to us.</p>
<p>Austin is the city where we met and fell in love — we’re excited to share it with you on our wedding weekend!</p>
<h2 id="downtown">Downtown</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://24diner.com">24 Diner</a></strong>, Restaurant
<br>
We once ran into Reggie Watts here. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://drafthouse.com/austin/the_ritz">Alamo Drafthouse Ritz</a></strong>, Movie Theater
<br>
Many theaters serve good grub and beer, but there’s nothing like the Alamo.  Staff-picked previews (vintage film clips, music videos, etc.) set the scene before your movie and make it a special experience.  Once, Leonard Nimoy surprised an Alamo audience expecting to see <em>The Wrath of Khan</em>, and he announced that they would see the world premiere of the new Star Trek film, instead.  ‘Nuff said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Grant says:</strong>  See if they have any events like old movies with special guests, or Master Pancake Theater (think MST3K).</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa says:</strong>  Try the chocolate chip cookies!  Mmmm-azing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amysicecreams.com/6th-street">Amy’s Ice Creams</a></strong> (One of many locations), Desserts</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://thebestwurst.com">The Best Wurst</a></strong>, Food Truck</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cincoaustin">La Condesa Cinco De Mayo Block Party</a></strong>, Event
<br>
We are pretty sure this is an annual event.  Also, every year, we think there is a celebration at <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/fiesta-gardens">Fiesta Gardens</a>, plus Mexicarte presents “Cinco de Mayo: La Battalla” at the <a href="http://www.austintheatre.org/">Paramount Theater</a>.   Closer to the trip, we recommend checking out <a href="http://do512.com/">Do512.com</a> for fun Cinco de Mayo events!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://batcon.org/index.php/get-involved/visit-a-bat-location/congress-avenue-bridge.html">Congress Bridge/Austin Bats</a></strong>, Sightseeing 
<br>
The Congress Avenue bats reside here as early as March, but the best bat views are in August when the young pups join their mothers in nightly flights.  This May, you might just catch a few of them hanging around ;)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.driskillhotel.com/the-driskill-bar.php">The Driskill</a></strong>, Bar/Lounge
<br>
This gorgeous, historic hotel is said to be haunted!  Might be worth looking into ghost tours.  Or, ditch Casper to have a swanky cocktail at The Driskill Bar.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.easytigeraustin.com/">Easy Tiger</a></strong>, Bar/Lounge 
<br>
Laid back, nice atmosphere, good food.  These days, it’s our favorite spot downtown.</p>
<p><strong>East Sixth Street</strong>, Bar/Lounges
<br>
East Sixth Street is technically “East Austin,” not Downtown.  East of I-35 there are a variety of great bars, ranging from laid-back to posh.  It has a different crowd than the famed Sixth Street, which is frequented more by tourists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vanessa says</strong>:  <a href="http://www.riorita.net/">Rio Rita</a> is where many of us grad students would hang out during my UT days.  It’s known for its Bloody Mary.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://themagnoliacafe.com/">Magnolia Café South</a></strong> (One of two locations), Restaurant</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vanessa says:</strong>  The mudd is the best thing on their menu. But their peanut butter chocolate pie might make you fall in love – literally.  I raved about this pie to Grant when we began dating.  One day, during a particularly busy semester at UT, Grant asked me to take the night off to go out with him.  I declined, feeling obliged to stay in and catch up with work.  That evening, he surprised me at home.  I will never forget the sweet moment I opened my door and found him standing there with that brown paper take-out bag from Magnolia.  I loved this persistent, pie-bearing man.</p>

Right next to the Serie Project on Felix Ave. and Vargas Rd.  Thinking about all that conceptual art will make you work up an appetite.  Try the barbacoa taco – soft, cheeky, meaty, mmm.</p>

<p><strong>Grant says:</strong>  Yes, the name sounds weird. No, it’s not a deli. Hands down the best tacos anywhere. I’ve eaten the entire menu. You can’t go wrong. I like the puerco borracho, the mole chicken, the ceviche, or my favorite: El Picosito (Mondays only).</p>
