<p><em>Are you looking for <a href="/map_and_directions.html">directions</a>?</em></p>
<p>Located just outside of Austin, Camp Lucy is nestled in the hills of Dripping Springs and has a gorgeous mix of architectural details from around the world.  We have truly enjoyed working with the friendly staff there and learning about the property’s history.</p>
<p>Below are excerpts from the Camp Lucy website that describe the venue and the amazing family behind it.  We are excited to share this special place with you on our wedding day!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The property&#39;s path from family ranch to wedding and special event destination began when Whit&#39;s [owner] oldest son Ian moved to Asia several years ago…</p>
<p>Upon Ian&#39;s suggestion, Whit visited Asia, including Hanoi in Vietnam, where he discovered a wealth of French-Colonial antiques. As an avid antiques dealer and collector, Whit is always on the hunt for the truly unique and special antique and, in Vietnam, he found what could be the ultimate antique - an 1880s Catholic church. On the brink of destruction to make way for a new church, the gorgeous 19th Century chapel, built from intricately carved ironwood, was available for purchase. Whit was sold. </p>
<p>The chapel was carefully disassembled and packed in sea-land containers, all of the timbers and tiles painstakingly photographed, labeled, and provided with a diagram and video to show how the church would go back together for its new life in Texas. </p>
<p>After a long sea and land voyage, the chapel arrived in Dripping Springs where it was reassembled and a campanile added to hold a 19th Century French bell which, today, signals happy events at Camp Lucy. </p>
<p>The original chapel was soon joined by a second French Colonial church from the 1930s, reconstructed at Camp Lucy and roofed with 1920s Ludowici tile repurposed from the Bexar County Courthouse in downtown San Antonio. The courthouse was getting a new roof and now the deep green glaze of these antique tiles is the crowning glory on the Camp Lucy pavilion.</p>
<p>Today, the original chapel, pavilion, and events hall, along with surrounding gardens, stone terrace, arch, and great lawn are collectively known as Ian&#39;s Chapel to honor Whit&#39;s son who not only sparked this grand adventure, but also left this world far too soon on December 23, 2011, shortly after marrying the love of his life, Sandra Hanks, at Camp Lucy.</p>
